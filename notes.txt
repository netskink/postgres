These are the files from /usr/share/doc/postgresql-doc-9.3/tutorial
I created them by installing the docs then changing to the above directory and issuing make
I copied the resultant .sql files to here.

After you create a table, and you want to import a csv file do this:

This assumes:
o Its a .csv file.
o The .csv has a header.
o The primary key is not in the csv but in the table.
COPY some_schema.some_table(some_field,another_field) from '/path/to/some.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER ;
